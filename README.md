Conway's Game of Life
======

A simulation of Conway's Game of Life written in Python.

The game is quite simple:

* Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.


Cell Positions:

[(-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,+1)]

[(0,-1), (0,0), (0,+1)]

[(+1,-1), (+1,0), (+1,+1)]
